KNOWN ISSUES
==============================================================================
1) If you get an error about a missing DLL, you need to donwload the MS VC
   redistributable package. You can find it here:

2) Migration Waves incorrect - The group-by "Migration Wave" is based on some shady guesswork
   based on dwarf ids. It is in no way 100% accurate, but can sometimes amaze me that it works :)
   
3) Dwarf and Squad translation names - This is brute force word-list searching. Verb conjugation,
   plurality and case are a crapshoot. But it's generally pretty close.
   
4) If you come across some other weird error, please post a bug report here:
   http://code.google.com/p/dwarftherapist/issues/entry and paste the 
   "run.log" file from the "log" directory into the bug report (or attach it)
   
   You can increase the amount of logging by running DwarfTherapist.exe with
   the "-trace" argument. You can do this via the shortcut, or via the command
   line
