CHANGES SINCE 0.3.0
==========================================================================================
 * HappinessColumn tooltip now shows the english version of the happiness level
 * Skills now correctly read experience (Fixed issue 1)
 * fixed issue 58 (can't repro it anymore)
 * Added ability to toggle an entire set at once for a dwarf or a group of dwarfs
 * added support for 40d14
 * (Fixed issue 5): Show skill-ratings legend somewhere
 * Moved the dock config around. Views, Sets, and Skill legend docks are now off by default and can be turned on in a variety of ways. They also default to floating windows that can be docked.
 * (Fixed issue 42): Hangs if game saved/continued without reloading
 * DT now heartbeats every second to DF. It a fort is unloaded or the game exits, DT will disconnect and allow reconnection.
 * (Implemented issue 40): Profession mgmt - separate file/export
 * Fixed a minor drawing bug with selected rows not showing the main grid underneath
 * Fixed a bug where the Viewmanager would try to draw tabs with invalid indexes
 * (Fixed issue 55): Confirm overwrite if View or Set name exists
	This dialog only pops up when you aren't editing. To prevent accidental clobbering.
	Cases where it shows up:
		Edit View1, change the name to View2(which already exists)
		New view, change the name to View2(which already exists)
		Will not show up on edit if the original name was View3 and you save it as View3.
	Since it doesn't show up in the general case, I've opted to not implement the "don't ask me again" checkbox
 * (Fixed issue 54) Blank name is allowed for set name
 * (Fixed issue 53) Main window doesn't show changes after changing group by
 * generic_useless.ini set wasn't correct, so I removed it
 * StateTableView now remembers which rows were expanded and which weren't
 * Setting the group by now goes thru ViewManager so the columns don't get stretched incorrectly 
 * (Fixed issue 57) Dwarf Name column resets to fixed-width
 * (Fixed issue 63) Options Window Duplicates Custom Professions
 * (Fixes issue 61) customizable skill icons
 * (Fixes issue 62) option to turn of shading
 * some minor speedups based on a trial of profiler
 * Dwarf::nice_name() is now cached since it hardly ever changes
 * GameDataReader now caches skill names and skill level names (and uses them)
 * UberDelegate now passes adjusted rectangles by reference to the sub-painters for less stack thrashing
 * Less QString::operator+ usage, since it seems to cause reallocations and is generally slow as fucking hell
 * Found some spots where build_rows() was being called multiple times and being slow
